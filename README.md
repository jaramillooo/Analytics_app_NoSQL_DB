## Project Objective: 
 This is an application that interacts with MongoDB, Dgraph, ChromaDB and Cassandra, demonstrating how to work with document, graph, and wide-column data models in a real-world scenario.

## Social Media Analytics Tool
- MongoDB: Stores user profiles and preferences.
- Dgraph: Tracks relationships between users (followers, likes, comments).
- Cassandra: Logs user activity over time (e.g., posts, logins).

Social media analytics is a highly valuable domain, where user interactions generate massive amounts of complex, interrelated data. Therefore we are gonna learn to work with tracking relationships and future connections for clustering and relations betweeen users and given information. 
Developing an application that integrates MongoDB, Dgraph, ChromaDB, and Cassandra is an ambitious and rewarding challenge that showcases expertise in working with different database models. We also would like to learn the how about the power of data synergy across document, graph, and wide-column databases are related..
This project mirrors real-world applications used by tech giants to optimize user engagement, target content, and enhance experiences.
